# Claude Code Memory Server

A Neo4j-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides intelligent memory capabilities for Claude Code, enabling persistent knowledge tracking, relationship mapping, and contextual development assistance.

## Overview

This MCP server creates a sophisticated memory system that tracks Claude Code's activities, decisions, and learned patterns to provide contextual memory across sessions and projects. It uses Neo4j as a graph database to capture and analyze complex relationships between development concepts, solutions, and workflows.

## Features

### Core Memory Operations
- **Persistent Memory Storage** - Store development tasks, solutions, and patterns
- **Intelligent Search** - Find relevant memories by context, content, or relationships
- **Relationship Mapping** - Track how different concepts, files, and solutions relate
- **Context Awareness** - Project-specific and technology-specific memory retrieval

### Advanced Intelligence
- **Pattern Recognition** - Automatically identify reusable development patterns
- **Solution Effectiveness** - Track and learn from successful approaches
- **Workflow Memory** - Remember and suggest optimal development sequences
- **Error Prevention** - Learn from past mistakes to prevent similar issues

### Development Integration
- **Task Execution Tracking** - Monitor what Claude Code does and how
- **Code Pattern Analysis** - Identify and store successful code patterns
- **Project Context Memory** - Understand codebase conventions and dependencies
- **Collaborative Learning** - Share knowledge across development sessions

## Architecture

### Memory Types
- **Task** - Development tasks and their execution patterns
- **CodePattern** - Reusable code solutions and architectural decisions
- **Problem** - Issues encountered and their context
- **Solution** - How problems were resolved and their effectiveness
- **Project** - Codebase context and project-specific knowledge
- **Technology** - Framework, language, and tool-specific knowledge

### Relationship Types
The system tracks seven categories of relationships:

1. **Causal** - `CAUSES`, `TRIGGERS`, `LEADS_TO`, `PREVENTS`, `BREAKS`
2. **Solution** - `SOLVES`, `ADDRESSES`, `ALTERNATIVE_TO`, `IMPROVES`, `REPLACES`
3. **Context** - `OCCURS_IN`, `APPLIES_TO`, `WORKS_WITH`, `REQUIRES`, `USED_IN`
4. **Learning** - `BUILDS_ON`, `CONTRADICTS`, `CONFIRMS`, `GENERALIZES`, `SPECIALIZES`
5. **Similarity** - `SIMILAR_TO`, `VARIANT_OF`, `RELATED_TO`, `ANALOGY_TO`, `OPPOSITE_OF`
6. **Workflow** - `FOLLOWS`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `ENABLES`, `BLOCKS`, `PARALLEL_TO`
7. **Quality** - `EFFECTIVE_FOR`, `INEFFECTIVE_FOR`, `PREFERRED_OVER`, `DEPRECATED_BY`, `VALIDATED_BY`

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Neo4j database (local or cloud)
- Claude Code with MCP support

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/viralvoodoo/claude-code-memory.git
cd claude-code-memory
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Set up Neo4j connection:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Neo4j credentials
```

4. Initialize the database schema:
```bash
python -m claude_memory.setup
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `NEO4J_URI` - Neo4j database URI (default: bolt://localhost:7687)
- `NEO4J_USER` - Database username (default: neo4j)
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD` - Database password
- `MEMORY_LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (default: INFO)

### Claude Code Integration
Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-memory": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "claude_memory.server"],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "NEO4J_USER": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage
