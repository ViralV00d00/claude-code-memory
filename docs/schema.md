## Relationship Properties

All relationships can have the following properties:

- `id` (string, unique) - Unique identifier for the relationship
- `strength` (float, 0.0-1.0) - Strength of the relationship
- `confidence` (float, 0.0-1.0) - Confidence in the relationship
- `context` (string, optional) - Context description

- `last_validated` (ISO datetime string) - When the relationship was last validated
- `validation_count` (integer) - Number of times the relationship was validated
- `counter_evidence_count` (integer) - Number of counter-examples

## Indexes and Constraints

### Constraints
```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT memory_id_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Memory) REQUIRE m.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT relationship_id_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (r:RELATIONSHIP) REQUIRE r.id IS UNIQUE;
```

### Indexes
```cypher
-- Type-based filtering
CREATE INDEX memory_type_index IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Memory) ON (m.type);

-- Temporal queries
CREATE INDEX memory_created_at_index IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Memory) ON (m.created_at);

-- Tag-based search
CREATE INDEX memory_tags_index IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Memory) ON (m.tags);

-- Full-text search
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX memory_content_index IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Memory) ON EACH [m.title, m.content, m.summary];

-- Quality-based filtering
CREATE INDEX memory_importance_index IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Memory) ON (m.importance);
CREATE INDEX memory_confidence_index IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Memory) ON (m.confidence);

-- Context-based queries
CREATE INDEX memory_project_path_index IF NOT EXISTS FOR (m:Memory) ON (m.context_project_path);
```

## Example Queries

### Store a Memory
```cypher
MERGE (m:Memory {id: $id})
SET m += $properties
RETURN m.id as id
```

### Search Memories
```cypher
MATCH (m:Memory)
WHERE m.title CONTAINS $query OR m.content CONTAINS $query
  AND m.type IN $memory_types
  AND m.importance >= $min_importance
RETURN m
ORDER BY m.importance DESC, m.created_at DESC
LIMIT $limit
```

### Create Relationship
```cypher
MATCH (from:Memory {id: $from_id})
MATCH (to:Memory {id: $to_id})
CREATE (from)-[r:SOLVES $properties]->(to)
RETURN r.id as id
```

### Find Related Memories
```cypher
MATCH (start:Memory {id: $memory_id})
MATCH (start)-[r*1..2]-(related:Memory)
WHERE related.id <> start.id
RETURN DISTINCT related, r[0] as relationship
ORDER BY r[0].strength DESC, related.importance DESC
LIMIT 20
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexing Strategy**: All frequently queried properties are indexed
2. **Full-text Search**: Enabled for content-based queries
3. **Relationship Traversal**: Limited depth to prevent expensive queries
4. **Query Optimization**: Use parameterized queries and appropriate LIMIT clauses
5. **Connection Pooling**: Configured for optimal performance under load

## Schema Evolution

The schema is designed to be extensible:

1. **New Memory Types**: Can be added by extending the MemoryType enum
2. **New Relationship Types**: Can be added by extending the RelationshipType enum
3. **Additional Properties**: Can be added to nodes and relationships as needed
4. **New Indexes**: Can be created for new query patterns

## Data Validation

All data is validated at the application layer using Pydantic models before being stored in Neo4j. This ensures:

1. **Type Safety**: All properties have correct types
2. **Constraints**: Required fields are present and within valid ranges
3. **Consistency**: Relationships reference valid memory IDs
4. **Normalization**: Text fields are properly formatted and normalized
